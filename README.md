# Blue Pisces Food Recipe Library

No matter how you got here, you're in the right place! This is where the Blue Pisces team stores recipes we've shared so others can try them out!

## Adding a recipe
1. Copy the `example.md` file
2. Rename the file to the name of your dish
3. Enter in your recipe information
4. Commit to the main branch with a message of your recipe (e.g., Damion's fried chicken initial commmit) 

## Changing a recipe
 
1. Make edits to the file
2. If it isn't yours, commit changes to a new branch and start a pull request to main (if it's yours, just merge to main)
3. Ask the owner of the recipe to review your pull request and they can decide to merge it
